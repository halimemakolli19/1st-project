     <h1><b><i>My Social Networks</i></b></h1>

     <p><i>Social Networks like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others are social networking site that makes it easy for people to connect and share with family and friends online.There are a lot of social media that are used to comunicate with people that are far us, to learn what's happening in the world and many other things. In social media you can watch what people are doing in their lives and learn new things too.</i></p>

     	<p><i><a href="https://www.Facebook.com">FACEBOOK</a> is a social media that is used by 1 billion people now, it was created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg. In 2006 everyone over the age of 13 could join Facebook with a valid email address. Facebook is a social media that you can use to comunicate with your family and your friends, in fact there are a lof of other way to talk with people but facebook is a way that you can share things with other people too. In facebok you can listen and watch news about the world and for your country too but you can see what your friends are doing and see what they share in facebook with you. You can join facebook with an email address and a password but you can use your phone number too, in facebook you can share you photos and your videos and deside who can see them, just you, your friends or let them public.The world is becoming eiser to know new people, make new friends and share things with people, by facebook you can know so much things even something you don't know, learn new things by reading and seeing too...
     		I have an account too and if you want to contact me, just add me:
     		 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011968208609">Lina Makolli</a></i></p>

     	<p><i><a href="https://www.Instagram.com">INSTAGRAM</a> is a social media that you can talk and share things with your friends, it's like facebook but i think that instagram is used by people more than facebook. You can create an account and share your selfies there but you can watch picture and video of others too. I think instagram is an easy way to meet new people and make new friends. you can share your best photos and videos and it displays on your profile. Other users who follow you see your posts in their feeds and can like and comment it. like other social networks, you interact with other people by following them, commenting, liking and saving posts in your account. in instagram you can sing up by your facebooks account or your email, all you need is a username and a password but you can change them in anytime... it's a good idea if you add a photo, a short bio and a website link if you have one if other people want to know who are you and what you're about... In instagram you can add story for 24hours and after 24hours it'll delete by itself..
     		Here is my account if you want to contact me:

     	<p><i><a href="https://www.Snapchat.com">SNAPCHAT</a> is a social media too but here you can see so much new things that facebook and instagram doesn't have... you can talk with friends in snapchat too but here the messages disappear after they're viewed, you can take picture and video, add filters save them and send them to your friends but these pictures and videos called snaps disappear after they're viewed too.Snapchat has Snap Map too that lets friends see each other's location on a map and it's always safe, in snapchat you can create snapstreaks with tour friends ad like facebook and instagram you can add stories for 24hours too. You can sign up just by your name, an email address and your birth date, to add people you can upload your contacts or search them by their name but you can add people by taking a picture of their Snapcode that is a special QR code
        unique to each user.In snapchat talking and sharing snaps with friends will be always fun.</i></p>


        <p><i><a href="https://www.Gmail.com">GMAIL</a> Or Google Mail is a free email service introduced by Google. It allows sending and receiving mails over the Internet.
        We can also send an email to multiple users at a time. The Gmail site is a type of Webmail.
        We can access the Gmail from Web and as an application in Mobile devices. We can also use the third-party program to access the Gmail. Such programs synchronize the email content through the protocols IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP (Post Office Protocol). The email address that we use to gmail, we can use in every other account that we have which helps us to verificate our accounts or we can change our passwords in other accounts too...
        In gmail you can talk and share links with others too but it's a good way to use it for your personal things like your instagram, facebook, snapchat but other social networks too. You can contact me in two email addresses:
